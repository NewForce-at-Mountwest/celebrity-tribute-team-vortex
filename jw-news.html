         MAY 14TH | HAND AND FOOT PRINT CEREMONY AT THE CHINESE THEATER IN LOS ANGELES
        </h3>
        <p>In the midst of promoting his new film John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum, Keanu Reeves has another reason to celebrate. The 54-year-old actor took part in a hand and footprint ceremony at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood on May 14, marking his blockbuster career of over 30 years. He was joined by several former costars, including Laurence Fishburne from The Matrix films and Halle Berry from John Wick: Chapter 3.</p>

    <p> Keanu first made his film debut in 1986's Youngblood and rose to fame as Ted Theodore Logan in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. He then went on to star in The Matrix trilogy and Speed, among many other movies. He doesn't show any signs of winding down, either. Keanu will be featured as a character in Toy Story 4 and will surely make us swoon in Ali Wong's Netflix rom-com, Always Be My Maybe. He's also reprising his Bill and Ted role in the highly-anticipated revival. He has a lot of projects to be proud of — both past and present!</p>
